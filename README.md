# Angular Express Seed

Start an awesome app with AngularJS on the front, Express + Node on the back. This project is an
application skeleton for a typical [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) web app for those who want
to use Node to serve their app.

The seed contains angular libraries, test libraries and a bunch of scripts all preconfigured for
instant web development gratification. Just clone the repo (or download the zip/tarball) and
you're ready to develop your application.

The seed app shows how to wire together Angular client-side components with Express on the server.
It also illustrates writing angular partials/views with the Jade templating library.

_Note: Although Jade supports interpolation, you should be doing that mostly on the client. Mixing
server and browser templating will convolute your app. Instead, use Jade as a syntactic sugar for
HTML, and let AngularJS take care of interpolation on the browser side._
